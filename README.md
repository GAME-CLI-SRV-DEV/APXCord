APXCORD(TM)
=========

APXCord is Waterfall with Velocity. Waterfall is a fork of the well-known [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) server teleportation suite.

Waterfall was discontinued on 2024, and it is recommended to switch to velocity.\
However there was no better alternative for BungeeViaProxy Available for Velocity, and we had no choice but to use Travertine as template.

## Why fork Waterfall, and Why you dont use velocity and Shared Hosting?



## How to (Server Admins)

You Need To Build it yourself.

To compile Travertine, you need git, gradle, and an internet connection.

Clone this repo, run `./travertine patch` from *bash*, get jar from `Travertine-Proxy/bootstrap/target`
